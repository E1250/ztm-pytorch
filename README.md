# ZTM-Courses 
Zero To Master website is a really good website to learn, I decided to learn PyTorch DeepLearning with them, and it was really great, I learned a lot of Great Topics about PyTorch - CNN, and much more.
* And their free E-Book that was really exciting - https://www.learnpytorch.io/ 
* GitHub Material Repo: https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/
* You can find solutions here - https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/tree/main/extras/solutions
* and this is the main branch - https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/
